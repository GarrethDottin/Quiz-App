-My Article
   I. Gives us a good frame of reference for when we have users for doing cohort analysis

   II. We can use the retention rate to understand the strength of a habit

-Great Article
   I. We should research the type of people that
   use product hunt its similar to fydo people who want to be in the know and those who suffer from Fear of Missing Out

   II. They did a great job of following the Desire Engine
   Internal Trigger: FOMO  Perceived Ability: Simple Design and Concept Commitment: having users write tag lines Variable Rewards: Community and a new winner every day

   III. They only started their service in the beginning of December

   IV. Product Hunt makes a great point of picking up an
   activity that people already do

   V. Makes me think we need to either simplify fydo to just apps or to-do list or we need to rebrand it to be simple and easy to explain the habit
